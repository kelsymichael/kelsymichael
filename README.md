👋 hi, my name is kelsy.

i like thinking about `systems` and how things relate.

lately i've been sharing what i learn on [posts.cv/kelsy](https://posts.cv/kelsy).

i've taken some time off of work to pause & reflect, i also happened to do that at the peak of the ux-bubble 🏄.

it's been an interesting experience that has given me time to disconnect and observe the rapid generative ai advancements.

i believe that people are going to pause and reflect on their 'whys', because i assure you, the ability to generate { whatever } with minimal thought + effort will impact everyone who 'does stuff on the comptuer'.

2024 is going to be interesting, and i'm excited to take it one day at a time.
